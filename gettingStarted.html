    <h3>Parts list</h3>

    <p>This is the list of items you'll need to get started with the project. 
       The first list contains items only needed during project setup, the second list contains 
       items needed to keep the weather station running.</p>

    <p>Items needed only during the setup:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>USB keyboard</li>
        <li>HDMI cable</li>
        <li>HDMI TV or computer monitor</li>
        <li>SD card reader</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Items to keep the weather station running:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Raspberry Pi</li>
        <li>USB Power supply (to power the Pi)</li>
        <li>Micro USB cable (to connect the Pi to the power supply)</li>
        <li>SD card (about 8GB is a good size)</li>
        <li>A USB Wireless Weather Station.<br/>I have successfully used thes models:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.clasohlson.com/uk/Weather-Station/Pr363242000">Clas Ohlson Weather Station</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.maplin.co.uk/usb-wireless-weather-forecaster-223254">Maplin USB Wireless Weather Forecaster</a></li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Getting started with your Raspberry Pi</h3>

    <p>Before continuing you’ll need to download an operating system for your Raspberry Pi. 
       For this tutorial I have chosen Raspian “Wheezy”, an easy to use Linux based operating system which is 
       endorsed by the Raspberry Pi foundation and seems to be very popular. You can download a copy from the 
       <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads">Raspberry Pi Downloads Page</a>.</p>

    <p>Once you have downloaded the image you need to copy it onto your SD card. 
    I suggest you follow the relevant <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup">RPi Easy SD Card Setup instructions at Elinux.org.</a></p>
