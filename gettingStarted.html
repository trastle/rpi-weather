    <h3>Getting started with your Raspberry Pi</h3>

    <p>First you’ll need to download an operating system for your Raspberry Pi. 
       For this tutorial I have chosen Raspian “Wheezy”, an easy to use Linux based operating system which is 
       endorsed by the Raspberry Pi foundation and seems to be very popular. You can download a copy from the 
       <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads">Raspberry Pi Downloads Page</a>.</p>

    <p>Once you have downloaded the image you need to copy it onto your SD card. 
    I suggest you follow the relevant <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup">RPi Easy SD Card Setup instructions at Elinux.org.</a></p>
